**BareMetalTestLab** is an open community and toolkit for automating testing, CI/CD, and firmware development for baremetal, embedded, and MCU platforms.

**We develop and maintain:**
- Self-hosted CI/CD solutions with hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) support
- Infrastructure for automated firmware flashing and hardware testing
- Utilities and scripts for lab benches, test frameworks, and hardware integration
- Documentation and best practices for embedded testing

**Mission:**
To make automated testing and CI/CD for embedded and firmware projects accessible, flexible, and convenient for engineers worldwide.

**Who is it for?**
- Embedded/MCU/firmware developers and testers
- Lab and testbench engineers
- Anyone building automated hardware testing workflows
